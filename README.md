# SampleCode
This is a python code for data cleaning and feature engineering to construct a dataset for statistical modeling.
The dataset consists of data such as date, location, perpetrators, etc related to political violence events occured in some African countries from 1997-2020. The goal is to visualize if political violence is high around the election day which is part of my PhD research. This code consists of data cleaning, feature engineering and visualizations before the statistical modeling. Specifically, I created two new variables called "Since" and "Until" from existing data that has been used to show the association between elections and violence because the visualizations from raw data did not show this particular association. "Since" and "Until" variables are the number of days to the event date since the previous election and number of days from the event date until the next election respectively. Then, my visualizations evidently show the positive relationship between violence and elections.
