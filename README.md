# SampleCode
This is a python code for data cleaning and feature engineering to construct a dataset for statistical modeling.
The dataset consists of data such as date, location, perptrators, etc related to political violence events occured in some African countries. The goal is to identify if political violence is high around the election day which is part of my PhD research. This code consist of data cleaning, feature engineering and visualization part before the statistical modeling. Specifically, I created two new variables called "Since" and "Until" from existing data that has been used to show the association between elections and violence. "Since" and "Until" variables are number of days to the event date since previous election and number of days from the event date until next election respectively. Then, my visualizations evidently show the positive relationship between violence and elections.
